## **🚀 Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting student grades using data-driven approaches:

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values and removed inconsistent data rows.

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

   * Log-transformed skewed features.

   * Standardized numeric columns.

   * Label-encoded categorical variables.

3. **Correlation Analysis**

   * Explored relationships between features and target variable.

4. **Modeling**

   * Split dataset into train and test sets.

   * Trained a **Linear Regression model**.

   * Evaluated using **RMSE, MAE, and R²** metrics.

   * Visualized residuals to check error distribution.
